# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure
- `apps/desktop/` holds the Electron app.
- `apps/desktop/main/` is the Electron main process.
- `apps/desktop/preload/` contains preload/bridge code for renderer access.
- `apps/desktop/renderer/` is the Vite + React UI; entrypoints live in `apps/desktop/renderer/src/`.
- `packages/` contains shared workspace libraries (`domain/`, `exec/`, `shared/`).
- `apps/desktop/dist/` is build output generated by the desktop build scripts; avoid editing it by hand.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install` installs workspace dependencies.
- `pnpm dev` runs the desktop app in development (Vite dev server + Electron).
- `pnpm build` builds the renderer and desktop main/preload bundles.
- `pnpm typecheck` runs TypeScript checks for main, preload, and renderer.
- `pnpm -F @open/desktop start` launches Electron from a built app.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript is used across main/preload/renderer; React is used in the renderer.
- Match the existing formatting: 2-space indentation, semicolons, and single quotes (see `apps/desktop/renderer/src/App.tsx`).
- Use `PascalCase` for React components and type aliases, `camelCase` for functions and variables.
- Keep file names aligned with their role (e.g., `App.tsx` for components, `main.tsx` for entrypoints).

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test runner is configured yet; `pnpm typecheck` is the current quality gate.
- If you introduce tests, add a workspace script and document the command here.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history only contains `Initial commit`, so no formal message convention exists yet.
- Use clear, imperative commit subjects and include a scope when helpful (e.g., `renderer: add diff viewer`).
- PRs should include a concise summary, testing notes (e.g., `pnpm typecheck`), and screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
- Link related issues or tasks when available.
